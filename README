NeuroTechEdu plugin to interact with Github.


== Description ==

Plugins used by the NeuroTechEDU website.


== Extending the EDUPlugin with new plugins ==

The EDUPlugin is just a loader used to load the plugins in the includes/ directory, including the admin settings page.
By convention, the plugins in includes are named <plugin_name>Plugin.php (such files are "php included" automatically).

To write additional plugins, the callbacks are wrapped in a class to allow different configurations through the class's member attributes.
The class contains two methods:
    - The constructor
    - The callback
    
The class constructor is used to set the states of the plugin.
The callback is the function that gets called when the wordpress hook gets triggered.
See includes/GithubReadmePlugin.php as an example.

The plugin is then loaded in EDU_Plugin.php .
To load a plugin, instantiate an instance of that plugin in the run_EDUPlugin function of the EDU_Plugin.php file,
along with the necessary parameters that the class constructor requires.
Depending on the plugin's use case, call add_action or add_filter member method of the EDUPlugin instance,
passing the hook, and an array containing an instance of the plugin and the name of the callback.
e.g. $ghplugin = new GithubReadmePlugin( $gh, $owner, $repo, $page_ids, "html" );
     $EDUPlugin->add_filter( 'the_content',
                             array( $ghplugin, 'callback_github_readme' ) );

To add additional options to the plugin's admin page, add the settings' section and field in the
EDUPlugin_page_init callback of the EDUPluginAdmin class in EDUPluginAdmin.php.

== GithubReadmePlugin ==

The GithubReadmePlugin set the content of a post (post or page) to the content of a Github Repo's readme.
The parameters that must be set from the settings page are:
     - User accessing Github's API
     - User token
     - Repo owner
     - Repo name
     - A list of comma separated page ids on which to apply the plugin
