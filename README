NeuroTechEdu plugin to interact with Github.


== Description ==

The EDUPlugin is a loader used to load the plugins in the includes/ directory, including the admin settings page.
By convention, the plugins in includes are named <plugin_name>Plugin.php .

To write additional plugins, the callbacks are wrapped by a class to allow different configurations.
The class contains two methods:
    - The constructor
    - The callback
    
The class constructor is used to set the states of the plugin.
The callback is the function that gets called then the wordpress hook gets triggered.
See includes/GithubReadmePlugin.php as for example.

The plugin is then loaded in EDU_Plugin.php .
